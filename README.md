# < Web Dev Playground />

A collection of mini web development projects built for learning, experimenting, and having fun with code! 🤓

## 🧪 What's Inside

This repo showcases my journey through web development, featuring small but functional projects that each explore different concepts, technologies, and creative ideas.

From a basic HTML and CSS QR code card to my first Chrome extension and beyond, each project represents a step in my learning journey and an opportunity to explore something new ✨🫶🏾.

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

I believe in learning by doing. Each mini-project here started with either:

- A problem I wanted to solve
- A technology I wanted to learn
- A fun idea I couldn't resist building

Feel free to explore, fork, or get inspired for your own coding adventures 🎊!
