## 🔍 Key React Concepts Demonstrated

### Component Composition

The project demonstrates how to break down a UI into reusable components and compose them together to create a complete interface.

### Props

The SkillBtn component showcases props usage by accepting and utilizing:

- `skill`: The text to display on the button
- `emoji`: An emoji icon to display alongside the text
- `color`: Dynamic background color for the button

### List Rendering

The Bio component demonstrates rendering lists in React by mapping through an array of skill objects and creating SkillBtn components for each item.
