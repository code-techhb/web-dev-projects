## 🚀 Project Overview

The Date Calculator allows users to:

- Adjust the step size (days to add/subtract at once)
- Increase or decrease the counter to navigate through dates
- See the resulting date displayed in a clean, readable format

This mini project was built as part of my React course to practice state management, props, and component design.
