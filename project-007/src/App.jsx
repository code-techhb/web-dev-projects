        This is a longer paragraph of text that will be collapsed or expanded
        based on how many words are shown initially. This component demonstrates
        how to create a flexible text expansion feature in React with
        customizable parameters and smooth animations.

          The art of programming is not just about writing code that works, but
          writing code that tells a story. Every function, every variable, every
          comment should contribute to a narrative that future developers
          (including yourself) can easily follow and understand. Clean code is
          not just about following conventions; it's about empathy for the next
          person who will read your work. When you write code, you're not just
          solving today's problemâ€”you're creating a foundation for tomorrow's
          solutions. The best programmers understand that code is read far more
          often than it's written, so they optimize for readability and
          maintainability above all else.
